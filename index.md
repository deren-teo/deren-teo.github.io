Welcome! I'm a final year mechatronic and machine learning student at The University of Queensland. This blog serves as a collection of memories and other possibly even useful things that I've gathered since beginning in 2023.

This blog began it's life as an assignment requirement in my final undergraduate year, for the course ELEC4630: Image Processing and Computer Vision. I would continue to describe how this all started, but actually, there's a [blog post](https://deren-teo.github.io/2023/05/14/how_to_start_a_blog.html) for that.

However it is you found yourself here, may you be entertained (and maybe even informed) during your time in this strange and wonderful land.
